    <h2 id="arguments">Arguments<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arguments"></a></h2>
    <dl><dt>cohort</dt>
<dd><p>(<code>data.frame</code> or <code>data.table</code>)
Cohort table with all relevant encounters of interest, where each row corresponds to a single encounter.
Must contain the following columns:</p><ul><li><p><code>genc_id</code> (<code>integer</code>): GEMINI encounter ID</p></li>
<li><p><code>hospital_num</code> or <code>hospital_id</code> (<code>integer</code> or <code>character</code>): Hospital ID</p></li>
<li><p><code>admission_date_time</code> (<code>character</code>): Date-time of admission in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format</p></li>
<li><p><code>discharge_date_time</code> (<code>character</code>): Date-time of discharge in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format</p></li>
</ul><p>If a <code>group_var</code> is specified (see below), this should be included in the <code>cohort</code> table as well.</p></dd>


<dt>time_period</dt>
<dd><p>(<code>character</code>)
The start and end points of the study period, e.g., <code>c('2019-01-01', '2019-12-31')</code>.
Should be specified in valid date format (e.g., <code>'yyyy-mm-dd'</code>).</p></dd>


<dt>scu_exclude</dt>
<dd><p>(<code>data.frame</code> | <code>data.table</code>)
Optional table containing special care unit (SCU) encounters. This is only required if patients who were in an SCU
should be excluded from the census calculation during time periods where they were in the SCU. The <code>scu_exclude</code>
table typically refers to the <code>ipscu</code> table (see
<a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1iwrTz1YVz4GBPtaaS9tJtU0E9Bx1QSM5" class="external-link">GEMINI database schema</a>).
However, users may want to filter the <code>ipscu</code> table by specific SCU unit numbers that should be excluded from the
census calculation. Entries where <code>scu_unit_number = 99</code> (<code>"No SCU"</code>) are automatically removed by this function.</p>
<p>The <code>scu_exclude</code> input table needs to contain the following columns:</p><ul><li><p><code>genc_id</code> (<code>integer</code>): GEMINI encounter ID</p></li>
<li><p><code>scu_admit_date_time</code> (<code>character</code>): Date-time of SCU admission in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format</p></li>
<li><p><code>scu_discharge_date_time</code> (<code>character</code>): Date-time SCU of discharge in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format</p></li>
</ul><p>For all entries in the <code>scu_exclude</code> table that have a valid <code>scu_admit_date_time</code> and
<code>scu_discharge_date_time</code>, the encounter will not be counted towards the census during any time periods where
they were in the SCU (i.e., time periods where they did not occupy a bed in a non-SCU ward). If no input is
provided for this argument, no exclusion will be applied.</p></dd>


<dt>group_var</dt>
<dd><p>(<code>character</code>)
Optional input specifying one (or multiple) grouping variables. Census numbers and capacity ratio will be calculated
separately for each level of a given grouping variable.
Note: Users do not need to specify hospital as a grouping variable since the function automatically groups the output
by <code>hospital_num</code>. Therefore, <code>group_var</code> should only be specified if additional grouping (e.g., by different medical
subservices, physicians etc.) is required. Multiple grouping variables can be provided as a character vector
(e.g., <code>group_var = c("medical_subservice","physician")</code>).
If no grouping variable is specified (default: <code>group_var = NA</code>), the function returns the total daily census numbers
and capacity ratios per hospital.</p></dd>


<dt>capacity_func</dt>
<dd><p>(<code>character</code>)
Optional input specifying the function to be used to define capacity for the <code>capacity_ratio</code> output.
Can either be a measure of central tendency to obtain typical occupancy (<code>median</code>, <code>mean</code>, or <code>mode</code>) or
<code>max</code> to obtain maximum occupancy. The <code>capacity_ratio</code> is calculated as <code>census/capacity_func(census)</code>.
Default is median (i.e., <code>capacity_ratio = census/median(census)</code>). If <code>"mode"</code> is selected and <code>census</code> has
multiple modes, the median of all modes is used to calculate the capacity ratio.</p>
<p>Note that capacity is calculated separately for each site (and grouping variable, if any).
Other types of measures (e.g., trimmed means), or year-over-year capacity ratios could be calculated based on the
raw census counts in the output (see vignette for more details).</p></dd>


<dt>buffer</dt>
<dd><p>(<code>integer</code>)
Buffer period (in days) to be applied at the end of the data availability period. Default is 30 days, i.e., census
counts (and capacity ratio) are set to <code>NA</code> for the last 30 days of available data for each hospital.
This is only relevant if the time period of interest is towards the end of the data availability period for a given
hospital. For example, if <code>time_period = c("2020-01-01","2021-12-31")</code>, and data are only available until Dec 31 2021
for hospital A, census counts will drop sharply during the last few days in Dec 2021 due to a "truncation bias".
Specifically, in the example scenario, there are encounters at hospital A who were admitted prior to Dec 31 2021,
but have yet to be discharged. Due to the fact that encounters only appear in the GEMINI database once they have been
discharged, the census counts in late December will decline abruptly at hospital A because patients who have not been
discharged yet are not included in the database. To prevent this decrease in patient numbers from affecting census
counts &amp; capacity ratio, outputs will be set to <code>NA</code> for the last <code>30</code> days at hospital A.</p>
<p>The default buffer period is set to <code>30</code> because the vast majority of patients is discharged within 30 days. That is,
a 30-day buffer period ensures that most admitted patients have already been discharged, and thus, will be included
in our data. However, users may specify a different buffer period since length of stays can vary widely between
cohorts. Therefore, users should explore which buffer period makes most sense for the data they work with.</p>
<p>Note that data availability differs across hospitals. Therefore, the actual buffer that is applied is calculated
separately for each hospital. If a hospital's data availability ends prior to the end of the time period of interest,
the buffer includes all last X days of that hospital's data (e.g., 30 days by default). If a hospital's data
availability goes past the end of the time period of interest, the actual buffer that is applied is based on the
difference between the specified buffer and the latest available discharge date at that hospital. For example, if
<code>buffer = 30</code> and a given hospital has more than 30 extra days of data past the time period of interest, no
additional buffer is applied.</p></dd>


<dt>time_of_day</dt>
<dd><p>(<code>character</code> | <code>numeric</code>)
Optional input specifying the time of the day the census/capacity ratio should be calculated at.
Default is 8am (<code>time_of_day = "8:00:00"</code>). Other times can be specified as a character (e.g., <code>"10:30"</code> for 10.30am)
or as numeric input (e.g., <code>14</code> for 2pm).</p></dd>


<dt>include_zero</dt>
<dd><p>(<code>logical</code>)
Flag indicating whether days with census counts of <code>0</code> should be treated as real 0s or whether they should be returned
as <code>census = NA</code>. Note that this is only relevant for edge cases where this function is applied to small cohorts or if
users specify a <code>group_var</code> with small samples resulting in counts of 0 on some days. In those cases,
the decision on whether or not to include 0s can affect the estimated typical capacity (and thus, the <code>capacity_ratio</code>
output).</p>
<p>By default (<code>include_zero = TRUE</code>), the function will return days where no <code>genc_ids</code> were hospitalized as <code>census = 0</code>.
This is the desired behavior in cases where counts of 0 patients are conceptually meaningful. For example, when users
want to analyze how many patients with a rare condition are in hospital on a typical day, days where <code>census = 0</code>
represent true counts of 0 patients (assuming the cohort provides sufficient coverage of all hospitalized patients).</p>
<p>In other scenarios, users may want to disregard days where <code>census = 0</code> by specifying <code>include_zero = FALSE</code>.
For example, when looking at daily census counts per physician, days where <code>census = 0</code> likely reflect days
where a given physician was not on service. Therefore, those days should not be included in the estimate of
physicians' typical patient volume.</p></dd>
