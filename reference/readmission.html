<dd><p>(<code>logical</code>)<br>
If <code>TRUE</code> (default), elective episodes of care are not considered to be true readmissions, and are therefore
removed from the numerator. Specifically, if the first encounter of the (n)th episode of care is elective
(<code>admit_category = 'L'</code>), the (n-1)th episode of care is not considered to be followed by a readmission
(<code>readmit(n-1) = FALSE</code>).</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-death">death<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-death"></a></dt>
<dd><p>(<code>logical</code>)<br>
If <code>TRUE</code> (default), episodes of care ending in in-hospital death are removed from the denominator. Specifically,
if the (n)th episode of care ended in death, it is impossible for a patient to be readmitted, and therefore the
episode of care is not considered in the readmission calculation (<code>readmit(n) = NA</code>).</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-maid">MAID<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-maid"></a></dt>
<dd><p>(<code>logical</code>)<br>
If <code>TRUE</code> (default): Episodes of care that involve MAID are not considered to be true readmissions, and are therefore
removed from the numerator. Specifically, if any encounter of the (n)th episode of care involves MAID, the (n-1)th
episode of care is not considered to be followed by a readmission (<code>readmit(n-1) = FALSE</code>).
Note that episodes of care involving MAID end in death, however, they are NOT removed from the denominator unless
the <code>death</code> flag is set to <code>TRUE</code> as well (recommended approach).</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-palliative">palliative<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-palliative"></a></dt>
<dd><p>(<code>logical</code>)<br>
If <code>TRUE</code> (default): Episodes of care involving palliative care are excluded from both the numerator and denominator.
Specifically, episode of care with palliative care as a type-M diagnosis are not considered to be true readmissions
(<code>readmit(n-1) = FALSE</code>). Additionally, similarly to death, palliative episodes of care cannot be
followed by future readmission and are therefore excluded from the denominator (<code>readmit(n) = NA</code>)</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-chemo">chemo<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-chemo"></a></dt>
<dd><p>(<code>logical</code>)<br>
If <code>TRUE</code> (default): Episodes of care that involve chemotherapy are not considered to be true readmissions, and are
therefore removed from the numerator. Specifically, if any encounter of the (n)th episode of care involves
chemotherapy, the (n-1)th episode of care is not considered to be followed by a readmission
(<code>readmit(n-1) = FALSE</code>).</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-mental">mental<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-mental"></a></dt>
<dd><p>(<code>logical</code>)<br>
If <code>TRUE</code> (default): Episodes of care for mental health are excluded from both the numerator and denominator.
Specifically, episodes of care that fall under CIHI's Major Clinical Category (MCC) 17 are not considered to be true
readmissions and are therefore removed from the numerator (<code>readmit(n-1) = FALSE</code>). Additionally, they
are not considered to be acute care and are therefore not included in the readmission denominator
(<code>readmit(n) = NA</code>)</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-obstetric">obstetric<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-obstetric"></a></dt>
<dd><p>(<code>logical</code>)<br>
If <code>TRUE</code> (default): Episodes of care that involve obstetric delivery are not considered to be true readmissions, and
are therefore removed from the numerator. Specifically, if any encounter of the (n)th episode of care involves
obstetric delivery, the (n-1)th episode of care is not considered to be followed by a readmission
(<code>readmit(n-1) = FALSE</code>).</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-signout">signout<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-signout"></a></dt>
<dd><p>(<code>logical</code>)<br>
If <code>TRUE</code> (default), episodes of care where the last encounter was self sign-out/left against medical advice (LAMA)
are removed from the denominator. Specifically, if the (n)th episode of care ended in self-signout/LAMA, it is not
considered in the readmission calculation (<code>readmit(n) = NA</code>).</p></dd>

    <p>This function returns a <code>data.table</code> containing <code>genc_id</code>, <code>AT_in_occurred</code>, <code>AT_out_occurred</code>, <code>epicare</code>
(see <code><a href="episodes_of_care.html">episodes_of_care()</a></code>), <code>readmit7</code> (default), and <code>readmit30</code> (default). <code>readmit7</code> and <code>readmit30</code>
are logical variables indicating whether or not an episode of care was followed by a readmission. Note that
readmissions are attributed to the last encounter of each episode of care. Episodes of care where the last encounter
has <code>readmitX = NA</code> have been removed from the denominator.</p>
<p>Note: If the very last encounter of an episode of care has a transfer-out coding (but the encounter associated with
that transfer does not exist in the GEMINI database), the episode of care is excluded from the readmission
denominator (<code>readmit(n) = NA</code>). This is to avoid inaccurate attribution of a potential readmission to
the hospital associated with the intermediate (i.e., not the last) encounter of that episode of care.</p>

    <h2 id="details">Details<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#details"></a></h2>
    <p>This function calls the <code><a href="episodes_of_care.html">episodes_of_care()</a></code> function to link encounters with acute care transfers into episodes
of care. When conducting readmission calculations using the function output, the number of encounters where
<code>readmission == TRUE</code> is the numerator, and the number of eligible episodes of care (where <code>readmission != NA</code>)
is the denominator. For example, 7-day readmission rate can be calculated by <code>mean(readmit7, na.rm=TRUE)</code>, where
<code>readmit7</code> is the variable returned by the <code>readmission()</code> function. This function is designed to be consistent
with <a href="https://www.cihi.ca/en/indicators/all-patients-readmitted-to-hospital" class="external-link">CIHI guidelines for readmission calculations</a>.
Please carefully review this reference before applying the function for research purposes. Users may choose to deviate from
the CIHI definition of readmission by setting any of the CIHI flags (see above) to <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
