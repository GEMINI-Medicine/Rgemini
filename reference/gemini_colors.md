# GEMINI colors

Compilation of commonly used color palettes for plotting purposes.

## Usage

``` r
gemini_colors(palette = 1)
```

## Arguments

- palette:

  (`character` or `numeric`)  
  Name or index of color palette. Run
  [`plot_color_palettes()`](https://gemini-medicine.github.io/Rgemini/reference/plot_color_palettes.md)
  to see options. By default, the first palette ("GEMINI Rainbow") is
  returned.

## Note

Vignettes that are colorblind accessible are marked with \*. For
palettes without \*, colorblind friendly combinations can be picked
according to the number of colors that are needed (e.g., if users only
need 2-3 colors, they should pick the ones that are most easily
distinguishable).
