# Introduction

This vignette contains detailed information about two functions that are closely related to each other: `episodes_of_care()` and `readmission()`. The `episodes_of_care` function is used in the `readmission` calculations in order to avoid that encounters that are linked via transfers (i.e., are part of the same episode of care) are counted as readmissions. The definitions used in both functions are based on CIHI guidelines for readmission calculations (see [here](https://www.cihi.ca/en/indicators/all-patients-readmitted-to-hospital)).


## `episodes_of_care()`
The function **`episodes_of_care()`** links together hospitalizations with acute care transfers into unique episodes of care. For each hospitalization (`genc_id`), the function returns the corresponding: `patient_id_hashed`, `time_to_next_admission`, `time_since_last_admission`, `AT_in_coded`, `AT_out_coded`, `AT_in_occurred`, `AT_out_occurred`, `epicare`. 


- **Coded Transfers (*AT_in_coded*, *AT_out_occurred*):** A coded acute care transfer refers to hospital coding of acute care transfers based on the DAD *Institution From* and *Institution To* fields. Specifically, a hospitalization has a coded transfer-in `AT_in_coded==T`, if `institution_from_type=='AT'` or `acute_transfer_in=='AT'`, vice versa for coded transfer out.


- **Occurred Transfers (*AT_in_occurred*, *AT_out_occurred*):** An acute care transfer is assumed to have occurred (`AT_in_occurred==T`, `AT_out_occurred==T`) if either of the following criteria are met:

> - An admission to a medical or intensive care service at a GEMINI hospital within 7 hours after discharge from another GEMINI hospital, regardless of whether the transfer is coded by hospital.

> - An admission to a medical or intensive care service at a GEMINI hospital within 7-12 hours after discharge from another GEMINI hospital, and at least 1 hospital has coded the transfer.


- **Episode of Care (*epicare*):** An episode of care refers to all contiguous inpatient hospitalizations admitted to any medical or intensive care service within the GEMINI network. Contiguous inpatient hospitalizations are defined based on occurred transfers (`AT_in_occurred==T` or `AT_out_occurred==T`). Episodes involving inter-facility transfers are linked regardless of diagnosis. By default, episodes of care are computed on all hospitalizations in the `admdad` table. See [*Section 3.4*](#sectionrecohort) and function documentation for options to compute epicare using a user specified cohort.

```


## `readmission()` {#sectionIntro}

The function **`readmission()`** computes whether or not a patient associated with an epicare was readmitted to a GEMINI hospital within a specified time window. For each hospitalization (`genc_id`), the function returns its corresponding: `AT_in_occurred`, `AT_out_occurred`, `epicare`, and `readmitX`. `readmitX` is a boolean variable denoting whether readmission took place during a time window X-days post-discharge. 

It is important to realize that readmission is determined by looking forward into data in the future. Therefore, `readmitX` is a measurement of quality of care of the current episode and evaluates whether factors in the current episode **LEAD** to readmission in the future.

For episodes of care involving acute care transfers, readmissions are attributed to the **LAST hospitalization** from which the patient was discharged before readmission; namely only the last `genc_id` of an episode have `readmitX` assigned, the rest are set to `NA`. 

By default, all records in the `admdad` table are used to calculate readmission. See [*Section 3.4*](#sectionrecohort) and function documentation for options to compute readmission on a user specified cohort.

> Mock example output of `readmission(db)` (mock data for illustration purposes, not real data. patient_id added to facilitate interpretation):

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/readmission_out_2.png", dpi = 100)
```


### General readmission rate calculation

- **Denominator of Readmission Rate:** Total number of episodes with potential to be readmitted. There are various conditions where episodes are removed from the denominator. For example, episodes discharged as death cannot be readmitted, are therefore, removed from the denominator of readmission rate calculation (see details in [*Section 2 CIHI flags*](#sectionCIHI)).

> An episode is removed from the ***Denominator*** by setting **<font size="3">`readmitX = NA`</font>** for the **current episode**.

- **Numerator of Readmission Rate:** Number of episodes within the denominator that were actually readmitted within the time window of interest. There are various conditions where episodes are removed from the numerator. For example, elective admissions might not be considered as readmissions, and therefore, episodes with elective admissions are removed from the numerator (see details in [*Section 2 CIHI flags*](#sectionCIHI)). 

> An episode is removed from the ***Numerator*** by setting **<font size="3">`readmitX = F`</font>** for the **preceding episode**.

The example code below shows how to calculate 7-day readmission rate properly using default settings. It is important to note the presence of NAs in the returned `readmitX` variable and remember to exclude NAs when calculating readmission rates:

```{r, eval=F}
# Load necessary libraries:
library(RPostgreSQL)
library(DBI)
library(getPass)

# Establish database connection
db <- DBI::dbConnect(drv,
                     dbname = "db",
                     host = "172.XX.XX.XXX",
                     port = 1234,
                     user = getPass("Enter user:"))

# Run default readmission calculation (with elective_admit=T and death=T)        
readm <- readmission(db) 

# Compute readmission rate based on readmission output
denominator <- sum( !is.na( readm$readmit7 ) ) 
numerator <- sum( readm$readmit7, na.rm=T ) 
readmission_7d_derived <- numerator/denominator

# Compute readmission rate based on readmission output (Alternative)
readmission_7d_derived <- mean( readm$readmit7, na.rm=T ) 
```


### GEMINI specific considerations

#### Readmission attribution when end of episode is unknown {#sectionATout}

- When the last hospitalization of an epicare has transfer out coded (`AT_out_coded`==T) and `time_to_next_admission` is greater than 12 hours or infinite, it suggests that the patient likely had been transferred to a hospital **outside of the GEMINI network**. It cannot be known for certain that the last hospitalization in our records is the last hospitalization of the epicare in reality. 

- To avoid inaccurate attribution of potential readmission, such epicares are **excluded from the denominator (`readmitX=NA`)** of readmission calculation . 

* The rationales are:
  + Not all hospitals/medical subservices are in GEMINI network
  + Transfers coded by hospitals are typically true transfers rather than errors. 

> Hypothetical example of special readmission attribution (compare colored entries in genc_id 103 vs 301, and genc_id 105 vs 201, and see how readmit7 is affected):

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/attribution_2.png", dpi = 100)
```
<br>


#### Buffer period based on each hospital’s data availability {#sectionBuffer}

- A patient needs to be discharged from hospital before appearing in GEMINI database. If a patient was readmitted to a hospital but has not yet been discharged by the time data is transferred to GEMINI, that readmission record will not be captured in our database. As a result, readmission rates could be underestimated in the time period before the latest data transfers.

- To mitigate this bias, **a buffer period** based on data availability of each hospital is applied to the readmission calculation. If an episode's discharge time is in the buffer period, the epicare is **excluded from the denominator (`readmitX=NA`)** of readmission rates. 

> Buffer Period = <br>
[ (Hospital’s last discharge date - Readmission window - Additional 30 days) <br>
, (Hospital’s last discharge date) ]
 
* The rationales are: 
  + The X number of days specified by the readmission window must have passed to allow for X-day readmission to occur; 
  + 95% of hospital admissions are discharged within 30 days based on GEMINI data. Therefore, for patients discharged within the buffer period, there is not enough time for readmission to happen and appear in our database; 
  + Since the buffer period is determined by each hospital's data availability, there is a possibility of inter-hospital biases that cannot be addressed. While we strive to minimize potential biases, we recognize that complete elimination may not be feasible. 

> Hypothetical example of how buffer period affects 7-day readmission of a patient:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/buffer_2.png", dpi = 100)
```


### Customizable features 

- **CIHI flags:** see [*Section 2 CIHI flags*](#sectionCIHI).

- **Readmission time window:** By default, the `readmission()` function computes 7-day and 30-day readmission rates. Users have the option to specify a customized time window using the `readm_win` argument. We recommend to exercise caution when customizing the readmission window, see [*Section 3.3*](#sectionrewin) for details. 

- **Restricted cohort:** By default, readmissions are determined by searching all the data in the database. There may be scenarios where users want to determine readmissions only among records within a restricted cohort. Both the `episodes_of_care()` and `readmission()` functions allow users to input a customized cohort using the `restricted_cohort` argument. We recommend to exercise caution when a restricted cohort is used, see [*Section 3.4*](#sectionrecohort) for details. 

- **Return readmission encounters:** By default, the `readmission()` function only returns TRUE/FALSE based on whether the genc_id was followed by a subsequent readmission. There may be scenarios where the readmission encounter itself is of interest to the user, (e.g. analyzing the exact time-to-readmission, or to analyze diagnosis and/or clinical outcomes of the readmission encounter). In this case, the user can set the `return_readmit_enc` argument as TRUE to return readmission genc_ids (1 additional column per readmission window) if there exists a readmission in that time window. 


# Readmission: CIHI flags {#sectionCIHI}

## CIHI readmission rate calculation

* There are total 8 CIHI flags as function input arguments: `elective_admit`, `death`, `MAID`, `palliative`, `chemo`, `mental`, `obstetric`, `signout`. Each flag removes episodes using different criteria when activated. More details on inclusion and exclusion criteria are discussed in `CIHI flags section` below and the [CIHI website](https://www.cihi.ca/en/indicators/medical-patients-readmitted-to-hospital)

* Rationale for default definition and readmission rate per CIHI definition
  + We only explain those two definitions as below since default definition is GEMINI-specific, and CIHI definition is used in MPR/OPR
  + Any other combinations of flags are potentially suitable for different project needs

* **Default definition**: the `elective_admit` flag and the `death` flag are default to TRUE in the readmission function. If users set them to FALSE, warning messages will be displayed. The remaining six flags are default to FALSE.
  + Elective admission is excluded since it's planned. Thus, the corresponding episode of care is ineligible for readmission calculations and is therefore removed from the denominator.
  + It's impossible for an episode of care which ends in death to be followed by a readmission, thus, the corresponding episode of care is ineligible for readmission calculations and is therefore removed from the denominator. 

* **CIHI definition**:  To compute readmission rate adhering to the CIHI definition, **ALL** 8 flags need to be set to TRUE.
  + The main purpose of having 8 flags in design is to match CIHI definition, however, we have come up with potential rationale under the corresponding flag sections for your reference
  + Detailed flag definitions can be found below (or in the comments in `readmission.R` script)
  


```{r, eval=F}
res <- readmission (db, elective_admit=T, death=T, MAID = T, palliative=T, chemo=T, mental=T, obstetric = T, signout = T)
readmission_7d_derived_cihi = mean( res$readmit7, na.rm=T)
readmission_30d_derived_cihi = mean( res$readmit30, na.rm=T)
```


## Overview of numerator & denominator removal by flag

> There are 8 CIHI flags, each of which can be set to `TRUE` or `FALSE`. The `elective` and `death` flags are `TRUE` by default. Each flag results in removal of a given episode of care from the numerator and/or denominator as illustrated in the flow chart below. Note that some flags (mental & palliative) result in the removal from both numerator *and* denominator:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/flags_diagram_2.png", dpi = 100)
```


## Flag details
**Disclaimer**: all the examples (focus on red text in tables) below are mock final outputs of `readmission.R`

### Elective flag
- An episode of care is considered elective if the **FIRST** encounter of that episode is elective (`admit_category = 'L'`)
- Episodes with elective admission are removed from the numerator because they are planned hospitalizations, and therefore, are not reflective of quality of care

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/elective_2.png", dpi = 100)
```


### Death flag
- Episodes of care ending in death are indicated by DAD Discharge Disposition Codes 07, 72, 73, and 74
- If the index admission results in death, there cannot be any readmission. Therefore, episodes of care with death are excluded from the denominator (`reamitX = NA`)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/death_2.png", dpi = 100)
```


### MAID flag
- Rationale for exclusion: MAID (medical assistance in dying) is planned, and therefore, readmissions involving MAID are not reflective of quality of care
- After 2018-04-01: An episode is MAID if its discharge disposition = 73
- Before 2018-04-01: An episode is MAID if **ANY** `genc_id` of an epicare has discharge disposition = 7 **AND** all 3 records of drugs (1st drug lets patient relax, 2nd drug stops heart beat, 3rd drug stops brain function; indicated by intervention codes)
- If an epicare has **ANY** encounter with MAID, it is not considered to be a true readmission and is removed from the numerator.
- Note: If `death = TRUE`, the epicare with MAID (which results in death) is additionally removed from the denominator. If `death = FALSE`, the epicare with MAID is kept in the denominator. The general recommendation is to set death to `TRUE` if MAID is `TRUE`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/maid_2.png", dpi = 100)
```

### Self sign-out / LAMA flag
- Rationale for exclusion: Self sign-out does not reflect physicians' decisions to discharge, and therefore, readmission should not be attributed to discharging physician/hospital
- When **LAST** encounter of episode of care has discharge disposition = self sign-out (i.e. LAMA - left against medical advice: 61, 62, 65, 66, 67), the episode is removed from denominator to avoid attribution of potential readmission to physician
- Note: While self sign-out is excluded based on the CIHI definition, coding practices of self sign-out may vary widely across hospitals/physicians (e.g., some physicians may not record self sign-out since it is a patient's right to leave on their own). Please keep that in mind if your analyses involve comparisons of readmission rates between providers. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/sign-out_2.png", dpi = 100)
```

### Palliative flag
- Rationale for exclusion: Palliative care is not considered acute care, and therefore, readmissions involving palliative care are not reflective of quality of care; additionally, encounters with palliative care typically result in death, and thus, the patient is not eligible for readmission calculations (see `death` flag above) 
- An episode is palliative care if it has an ICD-10-CA diagnosis code of Z51.5 as type MRDx
- When an episode of care includes **ANY** encounter with palliative care as most responsible discharge diagnosis, it is removed from numerator and denominator

### Chemo flag
- Rationale for exclusion: Chemotherapy is planned, and therefore, any readmissions involving chemotherapy are not reflective of quality of care
- An episode has chemotherapy if it has an ICD-10-CA diagnosis code of Z51.1 as type M, 1, C, W, X or Y
- When an episode of care includes **ANY** encounter with chemotherapy, the entire epicare is considered as a chemotherapy episode.
- Readmission with chemotherapy is not considered a true readmission, and it is removed from numerator.

### Mental health flag
- Rationale for exclusion: Admissions for mental health diagnoses are not considered acute care
- An episode is mental health if it falls under MCC = 17
- When an episode of care includes **ANY** encounter with a mental health diagnosis, it is removed from numerator and denominator

### Obstetric delivery
- Rationale for exclusion: Admissions for obstetric delivery are planned
- An episode is obstetric delivery if it has an ICD-10-CA diagnosis codes of: O10–O16, O21–O29, O30–O37, O40–O46, O48, O60–O69, O70–O75, O85–O89, O90–O92, O95, O98, O99 with a sixth digit of 1 or 2; or Z37 recorded in any diagnosis field
- Episodes of care that have **ANY** encounter with obstetric delivery are not considered a true readmission, and are therefore removed from numerator


# Practical examples & special scenarios

> This flow chart provides an overview of how readmission calculations can be customized for different research purposes. Depending on the research context, you may be able to use the derived readmission variables in the DB (see [*Section 3.1*](#sectionderived)). Alternatively, you can run the readmission function with customized CIHI flags ([*Section 3.2*](#sectioncustomCIHI)), customized readmission window ([*Section 3.3*](#sectionrewin)), readmission encounters, and/or a restricted readmission cohort ([*Section 3.4*](#sectionrecohort)):

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/customReadm_fig4.png", dpi = 100)
```


## Using derived variables in DB {#sectionderived}

**When to use:** 
  
- To get default/CIHI definition of 7-/30-day readmission, including all readmissions to any GEMINI hospital & to any medical subservice

**How to use:** Query the `derived_variables` table, which contains the two most commonly used definitions of 7- and 30-day readmission:
  
1) Default definition of readmission (excluding elective readmissions and death): `readmission_7d_derived`/`readmission_30d_derived`
2) CIHI definition of readmission (all exclusion flags, see [*Section 2*](#sectionCIHI)): `readmission_7d_derived_cihi`/`readmission_30d_derived_cihi`

**Example**: 7-day readmission rates of patients at phase-1 sites:

```{r, eval = F}
# get derived readmissions for phase-1 sites
readm <- dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT readmission_7d_derived FROM derived_variables 
                    WHERE hospital_id IN ('SMH', 'SBK', 'UHNTW', 'UHNTG', 'MSH', 'THPC', 'THPM');")

mean(readm$readmission_7d_derived, na.rm = T)
```


**Other examples**:
  
- MPR/OPR readmission rates
- Descriptive analyses of general readmission rates 
- Comparing overall readmission rates of patients with certain diagnoses/treatments
- ...
  
  
**Note:** The derived variables are based on the entire GEMINI DB. That is, they consider readmissions to any medical service at any GEMINI hospital. For that reason, they reflect overall/general readmission rates, which is a common variable of interest in many research projects.

However, there may be cases where you need to run the `readmission` function on a subset of the database by using the `restricted_cohort` argument (see [*Section 3.4*](#sectionrecohort)). 
  

## Customizing CIHI flags {#sectioncustomCIHI}

The derived variables in the DB only provide readmission values for the default & CIHI definitions of readmission, which are the most common definitions used in GEMINI research projects/reports. However, if another definition is required for specific research purposes, users can specify customized CIHI flags by setting each of the 8 CIHI flags to either TRUE or FALSE (see [*Section 2*](#sectionCIHI) for details). For example, run this code to exclude MAID (in addition to excluding elective admissions & death which are set to TRUE by default):

```{r, eval = F}
readmission(db, MAID=T)
```



## Specifying custom readmission window {#sectionrewin}

By default, the `readmission` function only calculates 7- and 30-day readmission. Users can provide an additional input argument `readm_win` that contains any readmission window(s) of interest (in days).

**Example:** Get 14-, 90-, and 180- day readmission. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
readm <- readmission(db, readm_win = c(14, 90, 180))  # specify readmission windows in days
```

All readmission windows should be provided as positive integers. Otherwise, the function will exit with an error message.

**Note:** Large readmission windows can lead to the exclusion of a high percentage of encounters at the end of the data availability timeline. This is because the function can only calculate readmissions for patients whose index encounter was prior to the buffer period. The buffer period depends on the length of the readmission window (e.g., 14/90/180 days) + an additional 30 days (see [*Section 1.2.2*](#sectionBuffer)). Therefore, the buffer period is longer for large readmission windows, which can lead to the exclusion of many patients. This is especially problematic if the cohort of interest is towards the end of the data availability timeline (e.g., 2021-2022 data). 

The function will show the following warning if more than 25% of the cohort are excluded due to the buffer period and/or due to the CIHI flags:
  
```{r, eval = F}
# Example of readmission rates for data from June 2021, resulting in a high % of encounters in the buffer period 
readm <- readmission(db, restricted_cohort = admdad[ymd_hm(discharge_date_time) >= "2021-06-01 00:00",])
```

```{r, echo=F, warning = T}
warning("Up to 41.3% of episodes of care have been removed from the denominator. This can be due to
        1) some CIHI flags (death/palliative/mental/signout) or
        2) removal due to the buffer period, which is 30 days + readmission window.
        The removal due to the buffer period was 20.5%/33.4% for 7/30-day readmission.
        Readmission rate estimates might be unreliable! Please consider re-calculating
        readmission rates with shorter readmission windows or with a larger cohort.")
```



## Running readmission function with `restricted_cohort` {#sectionrecohort}

You can run the `readmission` function on a subset of the DB providing an optional `restricted_cohort` input. There are 2 main reasons to restrict the cohort: 

1) If the REB protocol for your research project does not cover all encounters in the DB, or 
2) If you only want to analyse readmissions to certain hospitals/subservices due to a specific research question. 

In both cases, the `restricted_cohort` should be provided as a `data.table` containing a `genc_id` column with all relevant encounters. If you use `restricted_cohort` due to REB considerations, the `restricted_cohort` should include all `genc_ids` that are covered under the REB (see [*Section 3.4.1*](#sectionrecohort1) for details). By contrast, if you want to filter the cohort due to a specific research question, it is recommended to filter by episodes of care in order to keep all linked transfers in the DB (see [*Section 3.4.2*](#sectionrecohort2) for details).


**Important:** Running the `readmission` function with `restricted_cohort` means that only the encounters included in the restricted cohort will be used to derive episodes of care and readmissions. All other encounters are excluded from all computations.   

A warning message will be shown when the `restricted_cohort` argument is provided to notify the user that all computations in the `readmission` function (including the internal call to `episodes_of_care`) are limited to the provided cohort. Please carefully consider if using a `restricted_cohort` is appropriate/necessary in your case! You can ignore the warning message if you are confident that a `restricted_cohort` is required and you are sure you built your `restricted_cohort` correctly (based on `genc_ids` for REB scenarios vs. based on `epicares` for other scenarios). 

```{r, echo = F, warning = T}
warning("Note: Based on the user input, epicares will be computed solely based on the user specified cohort, instead of the default method. The default method computes epicares based on all available data in GEMINI database and is recommended. ",immediate. = TRUE)
```


### Restricting the cohort due to REB protocol {#sectionrecohort1}

**When to use:** 

- When the REB protocol of your study does not cover all encounters in the DB

**How to use:**

- Provide a `restricted_cohort` argument that includes all `genc_ids` covered by the REB

**Example:** The REB protocol of your research project only covers GIM encounters from 5 hospitals. In this case, it is important to ensure that only those encounters are included in the `readmission` function, while all other encounters in the DB should be ignored. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# note: users needs to define their own GIM_cohort table based on the criteria they want to use to define GIM encounters
readm <- readmission(db, restricted_cohort = GIM_cohort[hospital_num %in% c(101,102,103,104,105),]) 
```

The resulting readmission rates will only include readmissions from and to GIM services at the 5 hospitals that were included. Note that those results may be less reliable than readmissions derived based on the whole DB due to a loss of information about transfers to hospitals/subservices that are not included in the `restricted_cohort`. Specifically, the `readmission` function internally calls the `episodes_of_care` function, which inherits the same `restricted_cohort` that was provided to the `readmission` function. Therefore, any encounters that are not part of the `restricted_cohort` are  excluded from both the reamdission calculations *and* the generation of episodes of care.

**Note:** If you only want to calculate episodes of care (without calculating readmissions) for a cohort with REB restrictions, you can also run the `episodes_of_care` function in isolation and provide a `restricted_cohort` input to ensure your analyses are compliant with the REB. For example, to derive episodes of care for GIM encounters at 5 hospitals:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# note: users needs to define their own GIM_cohort table based on the criteria they want to use to define GIM encounters
epicares <- identify_epicare(db, restricted_cohort = GIM_cohort[hospital_num %in% c(101,102,103,104,105),]) 
```


If you are unsure about which encounters are covered by your project's REB protocol, please contact your manager! 



### Restricting the cohort due to research question {#sectionrecohort2}

**When to use:** 

- To calculate readmissions ***to*** specific hospitals/subservices (e.g., readmission to GIM only)
- To include/exclude certain encounters from readmission calculation due to research context (e.g., readmission with specific Dx) 

**How to use:**

To calculate readmission rates that only consider readmissions to certain hospitals/subservices/encounters, you can run the readmission function using a `restricted_cohort`. While restricting the cohort due to REB considerations should be done by filtering strictly based on `genc_id` (see above), restricting the cohort due to specific research questions should be done based on episodes of care in order to ensure that all linked transfers are considered in the `readmission` calculations. Specifically, for all hospitalizations of interest, all linked encounters of a given episode of care should be included. Please carefully read the examples below to gain a better understanding of how to create a `restricted_cohort` for research purposes. 


**Example 1:** Calculating how frequently GIM patients are ***readmitted to GIM services***:

In order to analyze readmissions of GIM patients to GIM services, the `restricted_cohort` should include **all encounters** of all episodes of care that have at least one GIM encounter. That is, even non-GIM encounters should be included as long as they are associated with the same `epicare` as the GIM encounters of interest. This ensures that all linked transfers are included in the readmission calculation, which minimizes the chance of encounters being inaccurately labelled as readmissions due to missing transfer information.

```{r, eval = FALSE, warning = T}
## Calculate epicares based on ALL encounters in DB (to ensure linked transfers are included)
epicares <- episodes_of_care(db)

## Identify all epicares that have at least 1 GIM encounter 
# note: users needs to define their own GIM_cohort table based on the criteria they want to use to define GIM encounters
GIM_epicares <- epicares[genc_id %in% GIM_cohort$genc_id, 'epicare']

## Get all encounters associated with GIM epicares (keep all encounters of those epicares, even those without GIM to make sure all linked transfers are accounted for)
GIM_epicares_all_enc <- epicares[epicare %in% GIM_epicares$epicare, 'genc_id'] 

## Calculate readmissions to GIM (considering all linked transfers in DB)
GIM_readm <- readmission(db, restricted_cohort = GIM_epicares_all_enc)

## Get 7-day readmission rate of GIM patients to GIM 
# note: numerator/denominator are based on unique GIM epicares, not GIM encounters (i.e., there may be several GIM encounters associated with a single GIM epicare, but those are only counted once; readmission is attributed to the last encounter within each GIM epicare)
mean(GIM_readm$readmit7, na.rm = T)
```

The resulting readmission rates indicate whether there was ANY GIM readmission for a given GIM patient within a 7-/30-day time window. Those readmissions are **not** necessarily the first readmission after the index epicare! For example, a GIM patient may have had a non-GIM readmission after the initial epicare, which is ignored in the calculation above. Therefore, interpretations about the causes for readmission should be done carefully as there may be intermediate epicares which readmissions could have been attributed to but were not considered due to the use of a `restricted_cohort`.  


**Example 2:** Calculating readmission rates of COVID patients who are ***readmitted with a COVID diagnosis***. In this case, the `restricted_cohort` should include all episodes of care that have ANY encounter with a COVID diagnosis. As in example 1, all linked encounters (even those without COVID diagnosis) should be included to make sure that all available transfer information is used in the readmission calculations. 
  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Get all encounters with COVID diagnosis
COVID_enc <- ipdiagnosis[grepl('^U07',diagnosis_code),'genc_id']

## Calculate epicares based on ALL encounters in DB (to ensure linked transfers are included)
epicares <- episodes_of_care(db)

## Identify all epicares that have at least 1 COVID encounter 
COVID_epicares <- epicares[genc_id %in% COVID_enc$genc_id, 'epicare']

## Get all encounters associated with COVID epicares (keep all encounters of those epicares, even those without COVID diagnosis to make sure all linked transfers are accounted for)
COVID_epicares_all_enc <- epicares[epicare %in% COVID_epicares$epicare, 'genc_id'] 

## Calculate readmissions with COVID diagnosis (considering all linked transfers in DB)
COVID_readm <- readmission(db, restricted_cohort = COVID_epicares_all_enc)

## Get 30-day readmission rate of COVID patients, only counting readmissions that also have a COVID diagnosis 
# note: numerator/denominator are based on unique COVID epicares, not COVID encounters (i.e., there may be several COVID encounters associated with a single epicare, but those are only counted once; readmission is attributed to the last encounter within each COVID epicare)
mean(COVID_readm$readmit30, na.rm = T)
```

The resulting readmission rates indicate whether patients with COVID had ANY readmission with a COVID diagnosis within a 7-/30-day time window. Those readmissions are **not** necessarily the first readmission after the index epicare with COVID diagnosis! That is, there may have been intermediate, non-COVID epicares, that were ignored in the readmission calculations.  


**Note:** In the examples above, only the ***highlighted italic parts of each sentence*** (which specify where patients are readmitted to) necessitate using `restricted_cohort`. If you only want to filter your cohort according to where patients are readmitted **from**, you should **NOT** use the `restricted_cohort` argument. Instead, simply query the derived variables for your cohort of interest (see example in [*Section 3.1*](#sectionderived)) to make sure you are including readmissions to all hospitals/medical subservices.



**Other special scenarios:** 

There may be more complex scenarios where the inclusion criteria for index admissions ("readmission from") are different from the inclusion criteria for readmission encounters ("readmission to"). For example, you might want to analyze readmission rates of surgery patients who are readmitted to GIM. In this case, your `restricted_cohort` should include all epicares that meet the criteria for index admissions plus any epicares that meet the criteria for readmissions. You will need to use several steps to create your `restricted_cohort`: 

1) Select **all encounters** of episodes of care that meet the criteria for index admissions: In the example scenario, include all encounters of epicares that have at least one surgery encounter. If you only want to consider readmissions to GIM, only include a single surgery episode of care per patient in order to avoid that subsequent surgeries are counted as readmissions. 
2) Select **all encounters** of episodes of care that meet the criteria for readmissions: In this example, to qualify as a GIM readmission, include all encounters of epicares that a) occurred after the index surgery admission and b) had at least one GIM encounter. Note: the implication of this step is that any intermediate non-GIM epicares are ignored.
3) Combine all encounters from step 1 & 2 to create the `restricted_cohort` of interest.
4) Run the readmission function with `restricted_cohort`.
5) Calculate readmission rates: Filter the output of the `readmission` function based on your index admissions (cohort created in step 1) in order to get readmission rates of surgery patients to GIM. This step is important to avoid that any admissions following GIM epicares (e.g., GIM to GIM readmissions or GIM to surgery readmissions) are included in the readmission rates. 

These steps are meant as a general guideline, but you may need to consider additional aspects for a given research project. Please make sure you carefully consider the implications of the decisions you make when building your `restricted_cohort`. You will also need to consider if any additional REB restrictions apply, in which case the `restricted_cohort` should be filtered based on REB considerations first before applying any additional inclusion steps.  


# FAQ

## Why are there missing values in the readmission flags?

Missing values (`NA`) in the returned readmission flags indicate that readmission status for these encounters cannot be determined. Encounters with `NA` are excluded from the denominator in readmission rate calculations, and thus, should be removed from any readmission analyses. There are several reasons for `NA` in the readmission flags:


1) **Buffer period:** Any `genc_ids` that were discharged during the buffer period (end of data availability period for a given hospital) are returned as `readmit = NA` because readmission cannot be reliably determined for these encounters (see [here](#sectionBuffer) for more details). Note that longer readmission windows will lead to a longer buffer period (i.e., more `NA`).

2) **Attribution to last encounter per episode of care:** If there are multiple encounters in a given episode of care, readmission will only be attributed to the *last* encounter. All previous encounters associated with the same episode of care will be returned as `readmit = NA` (see [here](#sectionIntro)). If attribution to the last encounter (i.e., the last discharging physician/hospital) is irrelevant for your research question, you may consider assigning the last readmission value to *all* encounters of a given episode of care. This could be relevant if you are only analyzing the first encounter per patient (or a randomly selected encounter).

3) **Acute transfers to non-GEMINI site:** If an encounter is followed by a transfer to an acute care institution but the transfer encounter does not exist in GEMINI data (e.g., transfer to non-GEMINI hospital), all encounters of that episode of care will be returned with `readmit = NA` (see [here](#sectionATout)). This is because readmission is typically attributed to the last encounter of an episode of care (see point 2 above), which in this case does not exist in our data. Additionally, we don't know how long a patient was hospitalized for at a non-GEMINI site, so we cannot reliably determine if any subsequent encounter occurred within the readmission window of interest.

4) **CIHI flags:** If set to `TRUE`, the following CIHI flags will result in `readmit = NA` for encounters meeting the relevant criteria (see [here](#sectionCIHI) for details): `death` (`TRUE` by default), `palliative`, `mental`, and `signout`
