A database connection to any GEMINI database.}

\item{cohort}{(\code{data.table} | \code{data.frame})\cr
Table with all relevant encounters of interest, where each row corresponds
to a single encounter. Must contain GEMINI Encounter ID (\code{genc_id}).}

}
\value{
(\code{data.frame} | \code{data.table})\cr
This function returns a \code{data.table} where each row corresponds to a
\code{genc_id} from the user-provided cohort input, together with the following
columns:
\itemize{
\item The user-provided census year: \code{census_year} (2016 or 2021)
\item DA the encounter resides in (based on PCCF+): \code{da_uid}
\item Neighbourhood-level income (continuous):
\item \code{atippe} (neighbourhood after tax income per single person equivalent)
\item \code{btippe} (neighbourhood before tax income per single person equivalent)
\item Neighbourhood-level income (quintiles from PCCF+):
\item \code{qnatippe} and \code{qnbtippe}: Quintiles of \code{atippe} and \code{btippe} calculated
based on \emph{national} income distribution
\item \code{qaatippe} and \code{qabtippe}: Quintiles of \code{atippe} and \code{btippe} calculated
based on distribution within a given community (based on census metropolitan
area, census agglomeration, or residual area within each province).
\item \% visible minorities: \code{vismin_pct}
\item \% with immigrant status: \code{immsta_pct}
\item \% with post-secondary education:
\item Including all respondents > 15 years of age: \code{ed_15over_postsec_pct}
\item Only including respondents between 25-64 years: \code{ed_25to64_postsec_pct}
\item Ontario Marginalization Index (continuous):
\item If \code{census_year} = 2021: \code{households_dwellings}, \code{material_resources},
\code{age_labourforce}, \code{racialized_NC_pop}
\item If \code{census_year} = 2016: \code{instability}, \code{deprivation}, \code{dependency},
\code{ethniccon}
\item Ontario Marginalization Index (quintiles):
\item All ON-Marg variables are additionally returned as quintiles, as indicated
by the suffix \verb{_q} (e.g., \code{households_dwellings_q})
}

\description{
The \code{neighborhood_ses()} function derives neighborhood-level SES variables for
a given encounter based on the dissemination area they reside in. All variables
returned by this function are based on Statistics Canada Census data and the
Ontario Marginalization Index (ON-Marg; see below for details).

For database versions since \code{drm_cleandb_v3} / \code{H4H_template_v4} users can
choose between 2016 vs. 2021 census/ON-Marg data. For earlier versions,
only 2016 census data are available. Note that the names of some
output variables vary by census year.

\section{Statistics Canada Census}{

The Statistics Canada census is collected every 5 years and provides a detailed
statistical portrait of communities across Canada, including information about
income, education, ethnicity, and immigrant status.

Census data are collected by dissemination area (DA), which typically covers
a population of 400-700 people. To enable linkage between GEMINI data and
DA-level location, the DA of a given encounter was derived from their postal
code using the \href{https://library.carleton.ca/sites/default/files/2023-03/PCCF\%2BUserguide-2021.pdf}{Postal Code Conversion File Plus (PCCF+)}
program.

The \code{neighborhood_ses()} function currently returns the following census
variables:
\itemize{
\item \href{https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/az/definition-eng.cfm?ID=pop123}{\strong{Income}}:
\item Statistics Canada sources information about household income from the Canadian Revenue Agency
\item PCCF+ provides an income per person equivalent (IPPE) by adjusting household income by household size
\item Both continuous income and national/community quintiles are returned
\item \href{https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/az/Definition-eng.cfm?ID=pop038}{\strong{Education}}:
\item Indicates a person's highest level of education: Based on the long-form census questionnaire,
which is only administered to 25\% of households
\item The function returns the \% of respondents with a post-secondary certificate, diploma, or degree
\item \href{https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/98-500/006/98-500-x2021006-eng.cfm}{\strong{Visible minorities}}:
\item Indicates whether a person identifies as a visible minority, defined as follows by
the Employment Equity Act: “persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in
race or non-white in colour” (e.g., Black, South Asian, Chinese, Latin American etc.)
\item Based on the long-form census questionnaire, which is only administered
to 25\% of households
\item \href{https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/az/Definition-eng.cfm?ID=pop148}{\strong{Immigrant status}}:
\item Indicates whether a person is, or has ever been, a landed immigrant or permanent resident
in Canada. This indludes those who have obtained Canadian citizenship by naturalization.
\item In 2021 census: Sourced from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada
\item In 2016 census: Based on the long-form questionnaire (25\% of households)
}

\section{Ontario Marginalization Index (On-Marg)}{

On-Marg is a neighborhood-level index measuring marginalization differences
between areas based on a subset of variables from the Statistics Canada census.

The index was derived from a principal component factor analysis on 42
variables, which resulted in 18 indicators along the following 4 dimensions:
\enumerate{
\item Households and dwellings: Measures housing density and characteristics of
family structure (e.g., living alone, \% dwellings not owned)
\item Material resources: Measures access to basic material needs (e.g., housing,
food, and clothing), education, and employment
\item Age and labour force: Includes indicators such as the \% of seniors (65+),
children, and those that are not part of the labour force
\item Racialized and newcomer populations: Measures the \% of people who are recent
immigrants (within last 5 years) or identify as a visible minority
}

In the 2016 version of ON-Marg, the 4 dimensions were called "Residential
instability", "Material deprivation", "Dependency", and "Ethnic concentration"
respectively. The dimensions were renamed in 2021 to avoid deficit-based
language and better reflect the census measures associated with each dimension.

All ON-Marg variables are available as continuous factor scores as well as
quintiles. Higher scores represent a higher degree of marginalization.
}

\section{Missing values}{

Some encounters could not be linked to Statistics Canada data due to missing/
invalid postal codes, or due to the fact that they reside in an area not
covereded by the census. These encounters will be returned with \code{da_uid = NA}.

Additionally, Statistics Canada suppresses results from certain DAs due to
low response rates or data quality issues. The corresponding census/ON-Marg
variables will be returned as \code{NA} for all \code{genc_ids} in those DAs.
