#' Simulate ipadmdad data
#'
#' @description
#' This function creates a dummy dataset with a subset of variables that
#' are contained in the GEMINI "ipadmdad" table (see details in
#' [GEMINI Data Repository Dictionary](https://geminimedicine.ca/the-gemini-database/)). It is a copy of the Rgemini function `dummy_ipadmdad`.
#'
#' The simulated encounter-level variables that are returned by this function
#' are currently: Admission date-time, discharge date-time, age, gender,
#' discharge disposition, transfer to an alternate level of care (ALC), and ALC
#' days. The distribution of these simulated variables roughly mimics the real
#' distribution of each variable observed in the GIM cohort from 2015-2022.
#' Admission date-time is simulated in conjunction with discharge date-time to
#' mimic realistic length of stay. All other variables are simulated
#' independently of each other, i.e., there is no correlation between age,
#' gender, discharge disposition etc. that may exist in the real data. One
#' exception to this is `number_of_alc_days`, which is only > 0 for entries
#' where `alc_service_transfer_flag == TRUE` and the length of ALC is capped at
#' the total length of stay.
#'
#' The function simulates patient populations that differ across hospitals. That
#' is, patient characteristics are simulated separately for each hospital, with
#' a different, randomly drawn distribution mean (i.e., random intercepts).
#' However, the degree of hospital-level variation simulated by this function
#' is arbitrary and does not reflect true differences between hospitals in the
#' real GEMINI dataset.
#'
#' @param n (`integer`)\cr Total number of encounters (`genc_ids`) to be
#' simulated.
#'
#' @param n_hospitals (`integer`)\cr
#' Number of hospitals to be simulated. Total number of `genc_ids` will be split
#' up pseudo-randomly between hospitals to ensure roughly equal sample size at
#' each hospital.
#'
#' @param time_period (`numeric`)\cr
#' A numeric vector containing the time period, specified as fiscal years
#' (starting in April each year). For example, `c(2015, 2019)` generates data
#' from 2015-04-01 to 2020-03-31.
#'
#' @return (`data.frame`)\cr A data.frame object similar to the "ipadmdad" table
#' containing the following fields:
#' - `genc_id` (`integer`): GEMINI encounter ID
#' - `hospital_num` (`integer`): Hospital ID
#' - `admission_date_time` (`character`): Date-time of admission in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format
#' - `discharge_date_time` (`character`): Date-time of discharge in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format
#' - `age` (`integer`): Patient age
#' - `gender` (`character`): Patient gender (F/M/O for Female/Male/Other)
#' - `discharge_disposition` (`integer`): All valid categories according to DAD
#' abstracting manual 2022-2023
#'    - 4: Home with Support/Referral
#'    - 5: Private Home
#'    - 8: Cadaveric Donor (does not exist in GEMINI data)
#'    - 9: Stillbirth (does not exist in GEMINI data)
#'    - 10: Transfer to Inpatient Care
#'    - 20: Transfer to ED and Ambulatory Care
#'    - 30: Transfer to Residential Care
#'    - 40: Transfer to Group/Supportive Living
#'    - 90: Transfer to Correctional Facility
#'    - 61: Absent Without Leave (AWOL)
#'    - 62: Left Against Medical Advice (LAMA)
#'    - 65: Did not Return from Pass/Leave
#'    - 66: Died While on Pass/Leave
#'    - 67: Suicide out of Facility (does not exist in GEMINI data)
#'    - 72: Died in Facility
#'    - 73: Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID)
#'    - 74: Suicide in Facility
#' - `alc_service_transfer_flag` (`character`): Variable indicating whether
#' patient was transferred to an alternate level of care (ALC) during their
#' hospital stay. Coding is messy and varies across sites. Possible values are:
#'    - Missing: `NA`, `""`
#'    - True: `"TRUE"/"true"/"T"`, `"y"/"Y"`, `"1"/"99"`, `"ALC"`
#'    - False: `"FALSE"/"false"`, `"N"`, `"0"`, `"non-ALC"`
#' Some entries with missing `alc_service_transfer_flag` can be inferred based
#' on value of `number_of_alc_days` (see below)
#' - `number_of_alc_days` (`integer`): Number of days spent in ALC (rounded to
#' nearest integer). If `number_of_alc_days = 0`, no ALC occurred;
#' if `number_of_alc_days > 0`, ALC occurred.
#' Note that days spent in ALC should usually be < length of
#' stay. However, due to the fact that ALC days are rounded up, it's possible
#' for `number_of_alc_days` to be larger than `los_days_derived`.
